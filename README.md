# Axelar Sandbox
This is where I put playground scripts that have to do with the Axelar bridge.  
`./hardhat` has a hardhat project set up. It's where I do extraneous smart contract stuff.  
`./dev-tools` is where I use the axelar dev-tools package.  
`./axelar-sdk` is where I play around with the axelar sdk.
